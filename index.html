                Hello World-----
                Welcome to the world of comics!
                <strong>Comics</strong> is a medium used to express ideas with images, often combined with text or
                 other visual information. It typically takes the form of a sequence of panels of images.
                 Textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia can indicate
                  dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information.
